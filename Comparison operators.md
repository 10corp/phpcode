Comparison operators in PHP are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators evaluate expressions and return a Boolean result (either true or false) based on the comparison's outcome. Here are the commonly used comparison operators in PHP:

| **Operator** | **Name** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \== | Equal | `a==b` |
| \=== | Identical | `a===b` |
| != | Not Equal | `a!=b` |
| !== | Not Identical | `a!==b` |
| \< | Less than | `a<b` |
| \> | Greater than | `a>b` |
| \<= | Less than equal to | `a<=b` |
| \>= | Greater than equal to | `a>=b` |

Equal (==): This operator checks if two values are equal and returns true if they are. It does not consider the data types.

Identical (===): The identical operator checks if two values are equal and have the same data type. It returns true only if both conditions are met.

Not Equal (!=): This operator checks if two values are not equal and returns true if they are different.

Not Identical (!==): The not identical operator checks if two values are not equal or have different data types. It returns true if either condition is met.

Greater Than (>): This operator checks if the left-hand operand is greater than the right-hand operand and returns true if it is.

Less Than (\<): The less than operator checks if the left-hand operand is less than the right-hand operand and returns true if it is.

Greater Than or Equal To (>=): This operator checks if the left-hand operand is greater than or equal to the right-hand operand and returns true if it is.

Less Than or Equal To (\<=): The less than or equal to operator checks if the left-hand operand is less than or equal to the right-hand operand and returns true if it is.

Additionally, you mentioned a special comparison operator called the "spaceship operator," also known as the "three-way comparison operator" (\<=>). It was introduced in **PHP 7** and is used for comparing two expressions. The spaceship operator returns:

*   0 if the operands on both sides are equal.
*   1 if the left-hand operand is greater.
*   \-1 if the right-hand operand is greater.

This operator is useful when you need to perform three-way comparisons in sorting or when ordering elements in an array.

Keep in mind that when using comparison operators, it's essential to be aware of data types and potential type coercion, especially when using the loose comparison operators (== and !=). For more strict comparisons, it's recommended to use the identical operators (=== and !==).

1.  Equal (==): This operator checks if two values are equal, regardless of their data types. For example:

```php
$a = 10;
$b = "10";
$result = ($a == $b); // true
```

1.  Identical (===): The identical operator compares both value and data type. It returns true only if both the value and data type of the operands are the same.

```php
$a = 10;
$b = "10";
$result = ($a === $b); // false
```

1.  Not Equal (!=): This operator checks if two values are not equal. It returns true if the values are different.

```php
$a = 5;
$b = 10;
$result = ($a != $b); // true
```

1.  Not Identical (!==): The not identical operator checks if both the value and data type of the operands are not the same.

```php
$a = 5;
$b = "5";
$result = ($a !== $b); // true
```

1.  Greater Than (>): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

```php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;
$result = ($a > $b); // true
```

1.  Less Than (\<): This operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

```php
$a = 5;
$b = 10;
$result = ($a < $b); // true
```

1.  Greater Than or Equal To (>=): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

```php
$a = 10;
$b = 10;
$result = ($a >= $b); // true
```

1.  Less Than or Equal To (\<=): This operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

```php
$a = 5;
$b = 10;
$result = ($a <= $b); // true
```

Special Comparison Operator - Spaceship Operator (\<=>):  
The spaceship operator was introduced in PHP 7 and is used for combined comparison. It compares two expressions and returns:

*   0 if both expressions are equal.
*   1 if the left expression is greater.
*   \-1 if the right expression is greater.

```php
$a = 5;
$b = 10;
$result = ($a <=> $b); // returns -1
```

```php
$a = 4;
$b = '4';
if ($a == $b)
{
    echo 'a and b are equal'; // this will be printed
    
}
if ($a === $b)
{ //try removing one = and see what happens
    echo 'a and b are identical'; // this won't be printed
    
}
```

The spaceship operator is useful for sorting and comparing arrays.

Keep in mind that when using comparison operators, be cautious of the data types being compared, especially with "==" and "===", as their behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results. **It's generally safer to use the identical operator "===" when you want to ensure both value and data type are the same during comparison**.

Let's analyze the PHP code step by step:

```php
<?php
$a = 5;
$b = 2;
$c = 4;
if ($a < $b + $c)
{
    echo $a<=>($c - $b);
}
else
{
    echo ($c - $b) <=>$a;
}
```

1. Three variables are defined: $a, $b, and $c, with the following values:
   - $a = 5
   - $b = 2
   - $c = 4

2. The code then enters an if-else condition:

   - The condition is: $a < $b + $c. In this case, $a (5) is indeed less than $b + $c (2 + 4 = 6), so the code enters the "if" block.

3. Inside the "if" block:

   - The expression inside the echo statement is $a <=> ($c - $b). Let's calculate it step by step:

     - ($c - $b) = 4 - 2 = 2
     - $a <=> 2 compares $a (5) with 2, resulting in 1, since $a is greater than 2.

4. The output of the code is the result of the comparison inside the "if" block:

   - Since $a (5) is greater than ($c - $b) (2), the output will be 1.

So, when you run the PHP code, it will output:

```
1
```
