If x=3 ,y=4, and z=6, what is the value of x, y, and z after executing the following code?

```php
<?php
if ($y + 2 == $z)
{
    $x = $x + 1;
}
else
{
    $z++;
}
```

Let's evaluate the code step by step with the given initial values:

Given initial values:
```
$x = 3
$y = 4
$z = 6
```

Step 1:
```
if ($y + 2 == $z)
```
Here, we check if the value of `$y + 2` is equal to the value of `$z`. Since `$y + 2` is `4 + 2 = 6`, and `$z` is `6`, the condition evaluates to `true`.

Step 2 (Condition is true):
```
$x = $x + 1;
```
The value of `$x` is updated by adding 1 to its current value (`$x = $x + 1`). Since the initial value of `$x` is `3`, after this step, the new value of `$x` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.

The final values after executing the code will be:
```
$x = 4
$y = 4
$z = 6
```

Note that the `else` part of the code won't be executed in this case, as the condition in the `if` statement was `true`. Therefore, the value of `$z` remains unchanged.
