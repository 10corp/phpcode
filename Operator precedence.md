Operator precedence is a crucial concept in programming languages, including PHP. It determines the order in which different operators are evaluated within an expression. When an expression contains multiple operators, operator precedence helps dictate which operation should be performed first.

In PHP, the operator precedence is similar to regular arithmetic operators, following the conventions of mathematics. Here's a general idea of PHP operator precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. Clone, new
2. Increment/Decrement (++, --)
3. Logical NOT (!)
4. Bitwise NOT (~)
5. Exponentiation (**)
6. Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%)
7. Addition (+), Subtraction (-)
8. Bitwise Shifts (<<, >>)
9. Bitwise AND (&)
10. Bitwise XOR (^)
11. Bitwise OR (|)
12. Comparison Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, ===, !=, !==)
13. Logical AND (&&)
14. Logical OR (||)
15. Ternary Operator (?:)
16. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=)

Please note that parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation within an expression. Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first before considering the overall precedence.

It's essential to understand operator precedence to write correct and predictable code. Always remember to use parentheses when in doubt or to ensure the desired order of evaluation.
