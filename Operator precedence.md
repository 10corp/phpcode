Operator precedence is a crucial concept in programming languages, including PHP. It determines the order in which different operators are evaluated within an expression. When an expression contains multiple operators, operator precedence helps dictate which operation should be performed first.

1. Precedence:
Precedence refers to the priority of operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. For example, in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, the multiplication operator (`*`) has higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`). So, the multiplication will be performed first, and then the addition.

Here's a brief overview of some common PHP operator precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. `clone`, `new`
2. `++, --` (post-increment, post-decrement)
3. `**` (exponentiation)
4. `!`, `~`, `-` (logical and bitwise negation)
5. `*`, `/`, `%` (multiplication, division, modulus)
6. `+`, `-` (addition, subtraction)
7. `<<`, `>>` (bitwise left shift, bitwise right shift)
8. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==` (comparison)
9. `&` (bitwise AND)
10. `^` (bitwise XOR)
11. `|` (bitwise OR)
12. `&&` (logical AND)
13. `||` (logical OR)
14. `?:` (ternary operator)
15. `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `.=` (assignment)

2. Associativity:
Associativity determines the grouping of operators with the same precedence. PHP operators can be left-associative or right-associative.

- Left-Associative: When operators are left-associative, they are evaluated from left to right. For example, the addition and subtraction operators are left-associative, so in the expression `10 - 4 + 2`, the subtraction will be performed first, followed by the addition.

- Right-Associative: When operators are right-associative, they are evaluated from right to left. The exponentiation operator (`**`) is an example of a right-associative operator. In the expression `2 ** 3 ** 2`, the exponentiation is performed from right to left, meaning `3 ** 2` is evaluated first, resulting in `9`, and then `2 ** 9` is evaluated, resulting in `512`.

It's important to be aware of operator precedence and associativity to avoid unexpected results and to ensure that expressions are evaluated as intended.

Example:

```php
$result = 2 + 3 * 4; // Result will be 14, as multiplication has higher precedence.
```

```php
$result = 2 ** 3 ** 2; // Result will be 512, as exponentiation is right-associative.
```

To clarify the evaluation order, you can use parentheses to group operations explicitly:

```php
$result = (2 + 3) * 4; // Result will be 20, as addition is now performed first due to parentheses.
```

Please note that parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation within an expression. Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first before considering the overall precedence.

It's essential to understand operator precedence to write correct and predictable code. Always remember to use parentheses when in doubt or to ensure the desired order of evaluation.

In PHP, as per the operator precedence rules, the expressions are evaluated as follows:

```php
echo "5 - 3 + 2 = " . (5 - 3 + 2); // 5-3+2 is treated as (5-3)+2
echo "\n";
echo "5 + 3 * 2 = " . (5 + 3 * 2); // 5+3*2 is treated as 5+(3*2)
echo "\n";
echo "15 / 3 * 5 = " . (15 / 3 * 5); // 15/3*5 is treated as (15/3)*5
echo "\n";
echo "42 + 7 % 2 = " . (42 + 7 % 2); // 42+7%2 is treated as 42+(7%2)
```

1. `echo "5 - 3 + 2 = " . (5 - 3 + 2);`

   Here, `5 - 3 + 2` is treated as `(5 - 3) + 2`, which evaluates to `4`. So, the output will be:
   ```
   5 - 3 + 2 = 4
   ```

2. `echo "5 + 3 * 2 = " . (5 + 3 * 2);`

   Here, `5 + 3 * 2` is treated as `5 + (3 * 2)`, which evaluates to `11`. So, the output will be:
   ```
   5 + 3 * 2 = 11
   ```

3. `echo "15 / 3 * 5 = " . (15 / 3 * 5);`

   Here, `15 / 3 * 5` is treated as `(15 / 3) * 5`, which evaluates to `25`. So, the output will be:
   ```
   15 / 3 * 5 = 25
   ```

4. `echo "42 + 7 % 2 = " . (42 + 7 % 2);`

   Here, `42 + 7 % 2` is treated as `42 + (7 % 2)`, where `%` is the modulus operator, and it gives the remainder of the division. `7 % 2` evaluates to `1`, so the expression becomes `42 + 1`, which evaluates to `43`. So, the output will be:
   ```
   42 + 7 % 2 = 43
   ```

The output of the PHP code will be:
```
5 - 3 + 2 = 4
5 + 3 * 2 = 11
15 / 3 * 5 = 25
42 + 7 % 2 = 43
```
