Sure! In PHP, the ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing simple if-else statements. It allows you to evaluate a condition and return one value if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false.

The syntax of the ternary operator is:

```php
$variable = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

Here's how it works:
- The `condition` is the expression that is evaluated.
- If the `condition` evaluates to true, the `value_if_true` is assigned to the `$variable`.
- If the `condition` evaluates to false, the `value_if_false` is assigned to the `$variable`.

Let's see a simple example:

```php
$age = 25;
$can_vote = ($age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
echo $can_vote; // Output: Yes
```

In this example, the variable `$can_vote` is assigned the value "Yes" if the condition `$age >= 18` is true (which it is, because `$age` is 25), otherwise, it is assigned the value "No".

You can also use nested ternary operators to create more complex expressions. However, it is important to use them wisely, as complex nested ternary operators can make the code difficult to read and maintain.

Here's an example of a compound ternary expression:

```php
$score = 85;
$result = ($score >= 90) ? "Excellent" : (($score >= 70) ? "Good" : "Average");
echo $result; // Output: Good
```

In this example, the variable `$result` is assigned the value "Excellent" if the `$score` is greater than or equal to 90, otherwise, it checks the second condition. If the `$score` is greater than or equal to 70, it assigns the value "Good", otherwise, it assigns "Average".

Ternary operators are handy for concise conditional assignments, but remember to use them judiciously to maintain code readability. In some cases, it might be better to use traditional if-else statements, especially when the conditions are more complex or there are multiple conditions to check.
