In PHP, the increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one. They come in two forms: pre-increment/pre-decrement and post-increment/post-decrement.

1. Pre-increment (++$variable): This operator increases the value of the variable by one before using its value in an expression.

```php
$variable = 5;
echo ++$variable; // Output: 6
echo $variable;   // Output: 6
```

2. Pre-decrement (--$variable): This operator decreases the value of the variable by one before using its value in an expression.

```php
$variable = 5;
echo --$variable; // Output: 4
echo $variable;   // Output: 4
```

3. Post-increment ($variable++): This operator increases the value of the variable by one after using its current value in an expression.

```php
$variable = 5;
echo $variable++; // Output: 5
echo $variable;   // Output: 6
```

4. Post-decrement ($variable--): This operator decreases the value of the variable by one after using its current value in an expression.

```php
$variable = 5;
echo $variable--; // Output: 5
echo $variable;   // Output: 4
```

Keep in mind that using the pre-increment/pre-decrement and post-increment/post-decrement operators in complex expressions can lead to confusion and unexpected results, so it's essential to be careful while using them.
