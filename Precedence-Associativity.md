In PHP, precedence and associativity are important concepts when dealing with multiple operators in an expression. They determine the order in which operators are evaluated and how operands are grouped together. Understanding precedence and associativity is crucial to correctly interpret and evaluate complex expressions.

1. Precedence:
Precedence refers to the priority of operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. For example, in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, the multiplication operator (`*`) has higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`). So, the multiplication will be performed first, and then the addition.

Here's a brief overview of some common PHP operator precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. `clone`, `new`
2. `++, --` (post-increment, post-decrement)
3. `**` (exponentiation)
4. `!`, `~`, `-` (logical and bitwise negation)
5. `*`, `/`, `%` (multiplication, division, modulus)
6. `+`, `-` (addition, subtraction)
7. `<<`, `>>` (bitwise left shift, bitwise right shift)
8. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==` (comparison)
9. `&` (bitwise AND)
10. `^` (bitwise XOR)
11. `|` (bitwise OR)
12. `&&` (logical AND)
13. `||` (logical OR)
14. `?:` (ternary operator)
15. `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `.=` (assignment)

2. Associativity:
Associativity determines the grouping of operators with the same precedence. PHP operators can be left-associative or right-associative.

- Left-Associative: When operators are left-associative, they are evaluated from left to right. For example, the addition and subtraction operators are left-associative, so in the expression `10 - 4 + 2`, the subtraction will be performed first, followed by the addition.

- Right-Associative: When operators are right-associative, they are evaluated from right to left. The exponentiation operator (`**`) is an example of a right-associative operator. In the expression `2 ** 3 ** 2`, the exponentiation is performed from right to left, meaning `3 ** 2` is evaluated first, resulting in `9`, and then `2 ** 9` is evaluated, resulting in `512`.

It's important to be aware of operator precedence and associativity to avoid unexpected results and to ensure that expressions are evaluated as intended.

Example:

```php
$result = 2 + 3 * 4; // Result will be 14, as multiplication has higher precedence.
```

```php
$result = 2 ** 3 ** 2; // Result will be 512, as exponentiation is right-associative.
```

To clarify the evaluation order, you can use parentheses to group operations explicitly:

```php
$result = (2 + 3) * 4; // Result will be 20, as addition is now performed first due to parentheses.
```
