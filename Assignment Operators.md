In PHP, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They allow you to perform an operation and store the result back into the same variable. Assignment operators combine the assignment (=) with other operators to perform the operation and assignment in a single step.

Here are some common assignment operators in PHP:

1. **Assignment operator (=)**: It is the most basic assignment operator, which assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 10; // Assigns the value 10 to the variable $variable
```

2. **Addition assignment (+=)**: It adds the value of the right-hand operand to the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 5;
$variable += 3; // $variable is now 8 (5 + 3)
```

3. **Subtraction assignment (-=)**: It subtracts the value of the right-hand operand from the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 10;
$variable -= 2; // $variable is now 8 (10 - 2)
```

4. **Multiplication assignment (*=)**: It multiplies the value of the right-hand operand with the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 4;
$variable *= 3; // $variable is now 12 (4 * 3)
```

5. **Division assignment (/=)**: It divides the current value of the left-hand operand by the value of the right-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 15;
$variable /= 3; // $variable is now 5 (15 / 3)
```

6. **Modulus assignment (%=)**: It calculates the modulus of the current value of the left-hand operand by the value of the right-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 17;
$variable %= 5; // $variable is now 2 (17 % 5)
```

7. **Concatenation assignment (.=)**: It appends the string value of the right-hand operand to the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$greeting = "Hello, ";
$name = "John";
$greeting .= $name; // $greeting is now "Hello, John"
```

These assignment operators are useful for concise and efficient coding when performing various operations and updating variables.
