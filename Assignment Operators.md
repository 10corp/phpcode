In PHP, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They allow you to perform an operation and store the result back into the same variable. Assignment operators combine the assignment (=) with other operators to perform the operation and assignment in a single step.

Here are some common assignment operators in PHP:

1. **Assignment operator (=)**: It is the most basic assignment operator, which assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 10; // Assigns the value 10 to the variable $variable
```

2. **Addition assignment (+=)**: It adds the value of the right-hand operand to the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 5;
$variable += 3; // $variable is now 8 (5 + 3)
```

3. **Subtraction assignment (-=)**: It subtracts the value of the right-hand operand from the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 10;
$variable -= 2; // $variable is now 8 (10 - 2)
```

4. **Multiplication assignment (*=)**: It multiplies the value of the right-hand operand with the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 4;
$variable *= 3; // $variable is now 12 (4 * 3)
```

5. **Division assignment (/=)**: It divides the current value of the left-hand operand by the value of the right-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 15;
$variable /= 3; // $variable is now 5 (15 / 3)
```

6. **Modulus assignment (%=)**: It calculates the modulus of the current value of the left-hand operand by the value of the right-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$variable = 17;
$variable %= 5; // $variable is now 2 (17 % 5)
```

7. **Concatenation assignment (.=)**: It appends the string value of the right-hand operand to the current value of the left-hand operand and stores the result in the left-hand operand.

```php
$greeting = "Hello, ";
$name = "John";
$greeting .= $name; // $greeting is now "Hello, John"
```

These assignment operators are useful for concise and efficient coding when performing various operations and updating variables.

Assignment operators in PHP are used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is the "=" symbol, and it is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:

```php
$variable = 10; // Assigns the value 10 to the variable $variable
```

Combined assignment operators are shorthand versions of arithmetic operations followed by assignment. They perform an arithmetic operation on a variable and then assign the result back to the same variable. These combined assignment operators help to simplify and shorten the code. Here are some examples of combined assignment operators:

1. Addition and Assignment: `+=`
```php
$number = 5;
$number += 3; // Equivalent to $number = $number + 3;
// Now, $number will be 8
```

2. Subtraction and Assignment: `-=`
```php
$number = 10;
$number -= 2; // Equivalent to $number = $number - 2;
// Now, $number will be 8
```

3. Multiplication and Assignment: `*=`
```php
$number = 4;
$number *= 3; // Equivalent to $number = $number * 3;
// Now, $number will be 12
```

4. Division and Assignment: `/=`
```php
$number = 15;
$number /= 5; // Equivalent to $number = $number / 5;
// Now, $number will be 3
```

5. Modulus and Assignment: `%=`
```php
$number = 17;
$number %= 5; // Equivalent to $number = $number % 5;
// Now, $number will be 2
```

6. Concatenation and Assignment (for strings): `.=`
```php
$name = "John";
$name .= " Doe"; // Equivalent to $name = $name . " Doe";
// Now, $name will be "John Doe"
```

These combined assignment operators are convenient when you want to perform an operation on a variable and update its value without writing the full expression explicitly.

```php
<?php
$a = 2;
$b = 3;
$b = ($a += ($b **= 5)); 
echo "\$b = ".$b;
```
Let's break down the code step by step:

```php
$a = 2;
$b = 3;
```

Here, you're initializing two variables `$a` and `$b` with the values 2 and 3, respectively.

```php
$b = ($a += ($b **= 5));
```

In this line, there are several combined assignment operators used:

1. `$b **= 5`: This performs the exponentiation operation on `$b` and assigns the result back to `$b`. So, `$b` becomes 3^5, which is 243.

2. `$a += ($b **= 5)`: Here, the combined assignment operator `+=` adds the value of the expression `$b **= 5` to `$a` and assigns the result back to `$a`. Since `$b` is now 243, `$a` becomes 2 + 243, which is 245.

3. Finally, `$b = ($a += ($b **= 5));`: The value of the entire expression `$a += ($b **= 5)` (which is 245) is assigned to `$b`. So, `$b` becomes 245.

```php
echo "\$b = ".$b;
```

This line simply prints the value of `$b` as part of a string.

After running this code, the output will be:

```
$b = 245
```
